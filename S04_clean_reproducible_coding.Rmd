* Generate modular code 
* Reduce repetition through the use of `loops` and `functions`

## What is required for absolute reproducibility?

So far in this workshop we have discussed the set-up and use of RStudio projects, 
with a focus on how to generate various outputs (`.pdf`, `.doc`, `.html`) from
an R Markdown document.
<br>

In addition to correctly formating our R Project, a completely **reproducible**
analysis requires all of the information for somebody (you or otherwise) to 
re-do your analysis and get the same results. This includes:

* All raw data - saved in a file within the project directory
* All code used to clean and process raw data as well as generate any figures - scripts should be saved in a file within the project directory
* All code and software (specific versions and packages) for analysis - all package installation and loading steps should be outlined at the top of notebooks (even if not evaluated)
* There should be no external "by hand" steps in the analysis
<br>

The benefits of reproducibility are:

* You can work out what you did and understand why - decisions are explained
* Even if the (raw) data is updated, the same analyses can be completed
* You can pass your project on to others
* You can provide useful examples of your code to people who wish to inspect or continue your project
* When you are ready to publish it is easy to re-check the analysis
<br>

R Markdown files along with `knitr` can be used to neatly generate reports that follow each step of the analysis.
<br>

## Style guidelines for neat coding

In addition to using R Projects and Markdown files to make our research reproducible, 
there are certain stylist aspects that make code easier to follow and read.
<br>

Why use a style guide?

* Clean code is easier to read and interpret - for you and others
* When code is clearer it is easier to spot mistakes
* Some style guide will help prevent potential problems e.g., avoiding `.` in function names
<br>

There are several good style guides available, including [Google's R style guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html),
[the Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org), [Hadley Wickham's R style guidelines](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html),
and [the Bioconductor styel guide](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/r-code.html).
<br>

Some key points that are shared across guides:

* Use `<-` not `=` for assignment
* Guidelines for naming objects: 
  + Decide on a consistent naming style e.g., camelCase or snake_case
  + Avoid spaces or dot (`.`) and instead use an underscore (`_`)
  + Only use meaningful names - nouns for objects (e.g., `todays_groups`) and verbs for actions (e.g., `make_groups`)
  + Avoid names of common functions e.g., `mean`
* Keep lines to 80 characters or less, as indicated by the margin column on your screen
* Put a space either side of binary operators (including `<-`, `+`, `-` and `=`)
* Do not put a space either side of a colon (`:`)
<br>
<br>

Broader guidelines - **omit needless code and avoid repetition**. We will discuss
how to do this in the next section of the workshop.

## Reducing repetition by creating functions

You are likely already aware of and comfortable with functions in R - we've 
used several throughout this workshop. Functions allow us to automate common
coding tasks in a more powerful way than copy-and-pasting. In addition to using
functions that already exist in base-R or R packages, we can write our own 
functions. 
<br>

The advantages of writing a function rather than repeating code:

1. You can give a function a meaningful name to outline what the code is doing
2. If you need to change something you will only need to update code in a single place
3. Reduced chances of making a mistake e.g., copying a chunk of code without changing a variable name
<br>
<br>

**When should you write a function?**  
It is good practice to write a function whenever we intend to run a set of commands
more than twice.
<br>
<br>

### Three steps to creating a function
There are three main things that we need to specify in order to generate a function:

1. A meaningful function name
2. A list of inputs to the function - the equivalent of standard arguments
3. A set of commands to be packaged into the function body
<br>

`function_name <- function(inputs) {function body}`

<br>

**Choosing a function name**  
The function name is what the function will be stored as within the R environment
and how we will call the function when we wish to use it. As with all naming in R,
function names should be clear, concise and meaningful. We usually use verbs in 
function names but nouns can also be used if they are descriptive and unambiguous.
For example, if we want to create a function to calculate the circumference of a 
circle, it would be sensible to call this function `circumference` rather than
`function_1` or `circumference_of_a_circle`.
<br>
<br>

**Defining the function inputs**  
The inputs to a function are the formal arguments, or 'parameters'. These are the
variables placed inside of the parentheses and separated by commas. When we call
the function we will provide actual values to these arguments. In the example of
circumference, the only input to our function will be the circle radius, *r*. 
This is the only variable in the equation *C* = 2 * pi * *r*. We will specify 
what to do with each input in the next section, the function body.
<br>
<br>

**Writing commands in the function body**  
The function body is a set of commands provided inside of a pair of curly brackets
(`{}`). These are the predefined set of commands that will be run every time we 
call our function.

```{r}
## Define function
circumference <- function(r) {
  
  2 * pi * r
}

## Use function
circumference(r = 2)
```
<br>

### More complex considerations when creating a function
**I want to set a default value for one of my inputs**  
To create a default value for one of the function inputs, simply include the 
value when defining inputs. The default values can still be over-written by 
specifying another value when calling the function. For example:

```{r}
## Define function with default value of r
circumference <- function(r = 1) {
  
  2 * pi * r
}

## Use function without specifying r
circumference()

## Use function and override default value of r
circumference(r = 5)
```

<br>
**I want my function to print value(s)**  
As you can see from the example above, as code is executed an output appears in
the same way as when we execute code normally. Usually it is the last evaluated
statement that will be returned. If we want earlier content to be returned we 
can use the explicit `return` function.
<br>

The `return` function is often combined with `if` or `ifelse` statements. For 
example, if an argument is missing we may wish to `return` a warning message to
ourselves to remind ourselves that a default value is being used. Maybe in this
case we would want to return an `NaN` value in response to a negative value of 
*r*, given that negative circumference is not possible.
<br>

```{r}
circumference <- function(r = 1) {
  
  2 * pi * r
  
  if (r < 0) {
    
  return(NaN)
    
  }
  
}

circumference(r = -3)
```

<br>

**I want my function to save value(s)**  
Sometimes we don't just want our function to print the result but also save this
in an object in our environment. There are several ways in which we can do this.
<br>

Let's try using the normal assignment operator.

```{r}
subtract_two_nums <- function(x, y) {
  
  answer <- x - y
}

subtract_two_nums(x = 9, y = 6)
```


The object `answer` only exists within the function and does not get saved 
within our R environment. This means that we can only use the `answer` object
within the function. If we want to assign the answer to an object in the R
environment we can use the `assign` function.


```{r}
subtract_two_nums <- function(x, y) {
  
  answer <- x - y
  
  assign("result", answer, envir =  .GlobalEnv)
}

subtract_two_nums(x = 9, y = 6)
```

We are assigning the value of `answer` to an object called `"result"`, which will
be stored in the global environment. It is easy enough to print and assign the 
output of a function at the same time.

```{r}
subtract_two_nums <- function(x, y) {
  
  answer <- x - y
  
  assign("result", answer, envir =  .GlobalEnv)
  print(answer)
}

subtract_two_nums(x = 9, y = 6)
```

<br>

**Challenge: Creating functions**  
Start by creating a simple function called `add_seven` which takes the argument
`x` and both prints and saves the output of adding 7 to the value of `x`.
<br>

<summary>Solution</summary> 
<br>


```{r}
## Define function
add_three <- function(x) {

  answer <- x + 7

  assign("updated_x", answer, envir = .GlobalEnv)  
  print(answer)
}

## Test function
add_three(x = 8)
```

</details>
<br>

Now try to create a function from scratch. Create a function to find the sum of 
all even integers between any two values.

<details>  
<summary>Solution</summary> 
<br>

```{r}
cumulative_even_sum <- function(x, y) {
  
  values <- x:y    # first get all integers between the two values
  
  even <- values[which(values %% 2 == 0)]  # subset values that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2
  
  sum(even)  # sum the even values
  
}


cumulative_even_sum(0, 10)
```

</details>
<br>

## Reducing repetitions by applying loops

Another way to reduce repetition in our code is through the use of loops. When 
you create a loop, R will execute all commands within the loop a specified number
of times or until a condition is met. There are three main types of loop in R:

1. the *for* loop
2. the *while* loop
3. the *repeat* loop
<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/loops.png")
```


### For loops - the most common R loop 

A for loop is the most frequently used loop in the R language and is used to 
carry out a set of commands in an iterative manner over a collection of objects.
This can be over each value of a vector, each column of a data frame, each 
component of a list etc. The loop will repeat the task a defined number of times.

<br>
`for (variable in sequence) {expression} `
<br>

The *sequence* is the collection of objects (eg., vector) over which the for-loop
iterates. A *variable* is an item of that collection at each iteration, and the
*expression* is a set of commands that we wish to apply to each variable.
<br>

Let's look at a simple for loop.

```{r}
for (x in 1:5) {
  print(x)
}
```
<br>

The expression inside of the loop, here `print(x)` is carried out iteratively
for each value of x. In other words, the loop will first be completed using 
`x = 1`, then once it has finished another iteration begins with `x = 2`, then
`x = 3`, until all variables in the sequence have been used. Even simple loops 
like this can be made useful in a real-world setting.

```{r}
for (month in 1:5) {
  print(paste("Month:", month))
}
```

```{r}
for (month in 1:5) {
  
  if (month < 3) {
    
    print(paste("Winter"))
    
  }
  
  else {
    
    print(paste("Spring"))
  }
}
```

<br>

**I want to store the output of my for loop**  
As was the case when we created our own functions, the results of a for loop 
are not automatically saved as an object in our environment. To do this we can 
append the results to an empty vector, which we define before the for loop.

```{r}
month_vector <- c()

for (month in 1:5) {
  
  month <- (paste("Month:", month))
  
  month_vector <- c(month_vector, month)
  
}

```
<br>

**Challenge: storing loop outputs**  
Alter the seasons for loop to save a vector of length 5 which contains the 
outputs of our loop. 

<details>  
<summary>Solution</summary> 
<br>

```{r}
seasons_vector <- c()

for (month in 1:5) {
  
  if (month < 3) {
    
    seasons_vector <- c(seasons_vector, "Winter")
    
  }
  
  else {
    
    seasons_vector <- c(seasons_vector, "Spring")
  }
}
```


</details>
<br>

**I want to use a for loop on a list**  
Sometimes we want to do the same set of commands to different objects. For 
example, we may have a set of data frames that each hold the same experimental
data taken from separate biological replicates. To do the same operations to 
these data frames, we could put these into a list and then loop over the lists.
<br>

Let's create some data frames and store them in a list.

```{r}
## Create example data frames

df_1 <- data.frame(month_vector, seasons_vector)
df_2 <- df_1
df_3 <- df_1


## Store data frames in a list
all_dfs <- list(df_1, df_2, df_3)

## Store new names
new_names <- c("updated_df1", "updated_df2", "updated_df3")
```
<br>

A list can be used to store data frames, vectors, matrices - most objects. To 
loop over items in a list we can use indexing.

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(all_dfs)) {
  
  df <- all_dfs[[i]]
  
  new_df <- df %>%
    as_tibble %>% 
    mutate(weather = ifelse(seasons_vector == "Winter", "cold", "warm"))
  
  assign((new_names[[i]]), new_df, .GlobalEnv)
  
}
```
<br>

### The `lapply` function

We can also loop through a list using the `lapply` function. The `lapply`
function takes two arguments, `X` and `FUN`. The value of `X` is the sequence
we want to apply to e.g., a vector or list. The `FUN` argument is short for
function, this can be a pre-existing function or we can define a function here.

```{r}
## Using lapply with a pre-existing function
lapply(X = c(1.34, 1.78, 2.34, 1.12), FUN = round)
```

```{r}
## Using lapply with a user-defined function
lapply(X = c(1.34, 1.78, 2.34, 1.12), FUN = function(x){
  
  x + 1
  
})
```
<br>

The output of `lapply` is a list - we can tell this from the double square 
bracket nomenclature. To do the same thing but have our output as a vector we 
can use `sapply`.


```{r}
## Using lapply with a user-defined function
sapply(X = c(1.34, 1.78, 2.34, 1.12), FUN = function(x){
  
  x + 1
  
})
```


**Challenge: Using loops and the apply family of functions**
Add another columns to each of the updated data frames to store numerical 
temperature values (make these up). Then use the apply functions (`lapply` or 
`sapply`) to loop over the updated data frames and output a vector containing 
the mean temperature. 

<details>  
<summary>Solution</summary> 
<br>

```{r}
## Put objects into a list
updated_dfs <- list(updated_df1, updated_df2, updated_df3)
new_names <- c("updated_df1", "updated_df2", "updated_df3")

## Create new temperature columns
for (i in 1:length(updated_dfs)) {
  
  df <- updated_dfs[[i]]
  
  df$temp <- c(4.8, 5.2, 13, 14.1, 12.7)
  
  assign((new_names[[i]]), df, .GlobalEnv)
  
}

## Use sapply to get vector containing mean temperature
updated_dfs_v2 <- list(updated_df1, updated_df2, updated_df3)
sapply(X = updated_dfs_v2, FUN = function(x) {
  
  x %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    pull(temp) %>%
    mean()
  
})
```
